Choosing a program file
-----------------------

NOTE:  All files ending in *.c* or *cod.jad, that is having a 'c' after the
	   '.' are ONLY for Blackberry.  So, if you're not using a Blackberry, just
	   ignore those.

It is important to choose the right program file.  This is because unlike
on the desktop, choosing a program file which uses features not available
on the phone may cause the program to not run WITHOUT an error message.
Phone makers are not required to give such a message, so many do not let
the user know why the program is not allowed to run.  So, to avoid
frustration, if you try to run one version of the program and you do not
see anything to show that it was run, try a version with less features.
There is a web site http://www.mobref.com/device/ which allows you to look
up which features are supported on most phones.  If JSR75 available is true, you can use
versions with jsr75_ in the name.

midp20_ programs/directories (without jsr75_) are for phones with MIDP 2.0.
This should work for all recent phones.

midp20_cldc11_smartphone@STAGEFILE@RSSReader.cso - MIDP 2.0 Blackberry CSO
midp20_cldc11_smartphone@STAGEFILE@RSSReader.jad - MIDP 2.0 jad
midp20_cldc11_smartphone@STAGEFILE@RSSReader.jar - MIDP 2.0 jar



midp20_jsr75_ programs .  For newer phones and usually with media (e.g. MP3)
	    capabilities, use files prefixed with
		midp20_jsr75_ if the phones have MIDP-2.0 and JSR-75 use midp20_jsr75_
		version.  To
		tell if you have a phone which supports JSR-75, you can use either
		of the other versions and go to Settings and look at phone jsr75
		if it says true, it supports jsr75 (this is different than progarm
		jsr75 which shows the version of the progam not the phone).
