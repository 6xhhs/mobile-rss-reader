#Documentations for Mobile RSS Reader
= Introduction =

 == Summary == 

The free RSS feed reader is a cell phone (mobile) J2ME MIDP  application that
is able to read most RSS servers/feed versions. RSS is a lightweight XML format
designed for sharing headlines and other content like blogs and news.   
Data
is stored on the device and updated on request.  This uses the internet which
service providers charge extra for, so you would best get an unlimited data
from your service provider.  
This should work with most recent devices as
they have MIDP 2.0 
program beginning with midp20_RSSReader... 
If it does not work, use the MIDP 1.0 
program beginning with midp10_RSSReader... 
for older versions.  
This is licensed under GPL.
