 == Summary == 

The free RSS feed reader is a cell phone (mobile) J2ME MIDP  application that
is able to read most RSS servers/feed versions. RSS is a lightweight XML format
designed for sharing headlines and other content like blogs and news.   
Data
is stored on the device and updated on request.  This uses the internet which
service providers charge extra for, so you would best get an unlimited data
from your service provider.  
This should work with most recent devices as
they have MIDP 2.0 
program beginning with midp20_RSSReader... 
If it does not work, use the MIDP 1.0 
program beginning with midp10_RSSReader... 
for older versions.  
This is licensed under GPL.

 == Install/copy Mobile RSS Reader to phone instructions == 

To install/copy RSSReader to the phone, you will need some communication  
method between your computer and your phone to be working (e-mail, cable, 
bluetooth, or infrared), and copy the midp10_RSSReader.jar, midp20_RSSReader.jar,
midp20_jsr75_RSSReader.jar file  
(that is in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mobile-rss-reader/downloads/list">zip file (this link) ) from the  
computer to the phone. If you have an old phone (that uses MIDP  
1.0), copy midp10_RSSReader.jar. The detailed steps are different 
from one phone to other, so please read the manual of your phone

Alternatively, you can use your phone browser to download
