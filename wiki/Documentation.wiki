The free RSS feed reader is an J2ME MIDP application that is able to read most RSS servers/feed versions. RSS is a lightweight XML format designed for sharing headlines and other content like blogs and news. Data is stored on the device and updated on request. This uses the internet which service providers charge extra for, so you would best get an unlimited data from your service provider. This should work with most recent devices as they have MIDP 2.0. If it does not work, use the midp10_... version which is for older versions. This is licensed under GPL. Source code authored by Tommi Laukkanen is at http://code.google.com/p/mobile-rss-reader/

The import feature has filters. This is because there are some OPML files that have 1,500 (SIC) links. This would cause the program to run out of memory not to memtion be unmanagable. Say you only want the ones that are about Tech. Use the name filter with 'Tech' in it to get just the ones with Tech. Some sites have an HTML file (URL) with links to RSS. This file will likely have both links for RSS and other links. Usually, the RSS links have a pattern in them like rss or xml. Put rss or xml in the link filter to just import these. Usually to use the HTML link feature, you will need to open the page with view source and see what to use as the filter.
